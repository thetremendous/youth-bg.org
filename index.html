CROSS-BORDER CREATIVITY ON THE RISE" PROJECT - 2007CB16IPO006-2011-2-85 </h2>
            <p class="tm-mb-6">
    The project responds to the programme’s strategy to reinforce territorial cohesion, competitiveness and sustainable development by setting up a joint cross border cooperation model to positively capitalize on the cultural and creative resources of the area, in compliance with the priority axis 2.2, by setting up a joint action plan- as the result of a network of mutual cooperation and understanding across borders - and concrete activities (workshops, study visits and creativity week event) to foster the potential of creative industry as a factor contributing to employment especially for young creative. The project will create a model, based on international good practice and methodologies, to value the rich cultural heritage and contemporary local artistic potential to curb brain drain among the younger generations and contribute to the growth and capacity of the target groups (local authorities and cultural organization in addition to young people) linked to tourist attractiveness.

                        <span id="moreText"> The project will create a model, based on international good practice and methodologies, to value the rich cultural heritage and contemporary local artistic potential to curb brain drain among the younger generations and contribute to the growth and capacity of the target groups (local authorities and cultural organization in addition to young people) linked to tourist attractiveness.
The cross border region can count a base of natural and historical resources which could be positively exploited to develop the service sector, in spite of a general dearth of tourism infrastructures.
These resources need to be put to use by a greater capacity of local institutions, economic stakeholders and civil society to plan policy and measures which value such resources as assets for socio-economic development.
The project addresses the need of the target group (local authorities and NGOS) to be better equipped in knowledge and strategies to use the potential of creativity as a leverage to improve competitiveness, increase the employment rate of young people (also entrepreneurship), which remains very low in the region (except for Sofia).
The project also addresses the need of young generations to find alternative and competitive jobs, by taking stock of the region’s cultural heritage and link it to a contemporary re-visitation of such heritage in order to find innovative ways to avoid brain drain and boost the local economy .
The relevance of the creative sector is already part of Serbian programs, although at an early stage. Creative Serbia 2020 is the National platform creative industries as a concept for poverty reduction, employment of young people and raising entrepreneurship in rural and undeveloped cities in Serbia.
Still, there are no systematic training and educational programmes available for cultural industry professionals.
In the Bulgarian region, civil society, local authorities and NGOs working the cultural sector are consolidating partnerships and the cultural /creative sectors have been increasingly perceived as an important contribution to local regional development, and an impact on the local labour market. This is result of a number of pre-accession projects and activities, on which the project intends to follow-up in the cross-border perspective.
Creativity on the rise responds to the described situation by implementing a number of actions that – in line with the objectives – target stakeholders at cross-border level, and beneficiaries in order to make progress on the potential of the creative sector in line with national and international strategies on culture and creativity as factors contributing to socio-economic development, by valuing cultural heritage and revisiting it by young generations – with the structural support of local authorities.
Actions will work to respond to the need of increasing governance and policy making of local actors in capitalizing on culture (also in terms of cultural heritage, traditional and modern or contemporary culture) and creativity for overall wellbeing and growth. Namely, the reinforcement and enlargement of the project’s partnership during the project (actions 3-4-5) becomes paramount to ensure the possibility to embed the project in future by making it a mainstream approach (and event) after the project’s end.
The need to nurture and develop creativity in young generations, in order to avoid brain drain and find solutions for the labour inclusion of young people will be tackled with a participatory approach - the creative labs and study visits - where young artist will mentor students.
The labs in fact go beyond  pure observation of cultural spectacles but look for active participation in the whole creative process. Study visits will not only “view” and “contemplate”, but will further the hand on “experience” of creating art, liberal and performing arts or by “participating” and “learning” (Actions 6- 7).
The outcomes of the actions will be shared with a wider public of experts and citizens (actions 8-9) to increase and raise the awareness of the creative industry for local development in a cross-border approach. The public events will also entail the active participation of visitors.
